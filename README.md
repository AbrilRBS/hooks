# Conan Hooks

Repository to develop **experimental** [Conan](https://conan.io) hooks for Conan >= 1.8.

**WARNING**: Hooks were originally named "Plugins"

## Hook setup

Place your hook Python files under *~/.conan/hooks*. The name of the hook would be the same one as the file name.

```
*~/.conan/hook/conan-center.py
```

## Hook activation

You can activate any hook with:

``$ conan config set hooks.conan-center``

If you handle multiple dependencies in your project is better to add a *conan.conf*:

```
    [hooks]
    attribute_checker
    conan-center
```
